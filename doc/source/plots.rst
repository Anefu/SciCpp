plots
=============================

Plotting functions defined in header <scicpp/plots.hpp>.

Base on the `Sciplot library <https://sciplot.github.io/>`_, which is a header only library.
Gnuplot is requried to run the executable.
Note that this is only required to use the plots module.

Extends Sciplot with some specialized plots available in Matplotlib (hist, psd, cohere, csd)


:ref:`hist <plots_hist>`
    Plot a histogram.
