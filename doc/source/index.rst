SciCpp's documentation
==================================

SciCpp has for objective to provide an implementation of the `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`_ 
functions for C++ 1D array types: ``std::array`` and ``std::vector``.

SciCpp is a lightweight header only library.
Its only dependence is the `Eigen <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page>`_
linear algebra library, which is also header only.

SciCpp is released under the MIT licence (because I can read it entirely and
have the felling I understand it).
